# Emaua
Emaua is a Swiss-Kenian association that offers to plant indigenous trees in Kenya for free to the local populations and farmers. Emaua also provides free lessons in biological agriculture, as well as the construction (for free), of furnaces that are more efficient that local ones.

To help their donors be better informed on the activities of the association, Emaua is developping a platform for each of their donors to be able to see where the trees they contribute to plant go. As such, this application, simply called *Project Emaua*, aims to provide a way for users to see, on Google Maps, where their contributions are used, and receive update on them.

## The Users and Their Options
The app allows for a user to create an account, with all the common features you'd find on any other websites (creating an account, changing the password, verifying your email, resetting your password, etc.). 

* Some users are admins : they see only the admin functionnalities. 
* Others are regular accounts, who can see Google Maps that display where trees are planted, and the projects they directly contributed to.
_________
## The App
The app is straightfoward enough. Once you are logged in and you verified your email, you can see displayed in front of you the location of all the trees Emaua planted, as well as a list of all the projects you contributed to.

There isn't much functionality to the app itself, it serves as a display case for Emaua to be more transparent.
